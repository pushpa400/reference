web deevlopment-static and dynamic

JNDS-java naming and directory service
web server-handle only web module i,.e http based communication i.e. req responsr-eg:tomcat
appl server-supports al enterprise service-eg:jboss,glasswish

EJB(enterprise java base) and seerv jap-appl 
ejb-web

JMS-java messaging seervice---one-one(subscriber) and broadcasting

java EE and java SE

JNT-java naming service--look up

java mailing service

RMI tech-obj present in other network,same or cross platform

JTA java transaction API

Servlet(class) and JSP--on server side--data is taken as text/html format,,image audio in binary format
servlet-pure java class,program,write html code witin,prg complied to .class and run on server,execption can be checked
JSP-simple page like html,where java code can be included,no need to complie,at run tim,JSP code converted to servlet code when client req,and den serv complied i.e bytecode and excuted--
done by jsp engine(translate jsp code to servlect code i.e. java)

CGI
common gateway interface
various d/f connections established for evrey requ,so resource is required too much

servlet architecture--multi threading came to picture,saves resource,throughput,efficient,login page
inly single instance i.e one object but muktiple threads is used to handle each req

synchronous mode-servl jsp--phone cal
asynchonous mode-ajax--respo not coming back,then req is blocked,cant do anything on the page until response is received
sms message

SERVLET API
javax.servlet --provides clas and interface and maintains own "life cycle mechanism"(server makes obj handles method by obj and executes
javax.servlet.http-sub package-handle all kinds of http protocol 

servlet-innterface--init() service() destroy()-abstract method--servlet life cycle
generic servlet class-extended to form generic servlect,gerneralised servlet,maintain any kind of protocol,noy protocol speciific
http servlet--to maintain only http protocol use http servlet
my sevlet

javax.servlet package contains: 
ServletRequest Interface 
ServletResponse Interface
 ServletContext Interface
javax.servlet.http package contains:
 HttpServletRequest Interface 
 HttpServletResponse Interface 
HttpSession Interface

servlet life cycle
init()
service() --doget dopost doput do delete
destoy()

deployment descriptor--- web.xml--mapping is written in this-- session tim out,whic page is loaded first,
configuration file is stored here

<servlet> servlet name-url map is mapped to name and servlet class-name is mapped to the class
<servlet-mapping>

servlet exception--servlet life cycle ,mechanism issue
IOException-issue in network realted issue,data to be sent or received,both are checked exception

!--action name is servelet name--!

---------------------------------
page transfer on server side
1)RequestDispatcher:Interface, called by request obj,no change in address bar  when there is change from one page to another,servlet req obj is needed to cal request
there are 2 methods 
forward--from current page to another new page
include--from curremt page to new page, and new page loaded into the same page
more wealthy
old req is never removed along with new req obj

RequestDispatcher rd=request.getRequestDispatcher("page url");
rd.forward(request,response);
or
rd.include(request,response);

2)sendRedirect()--- method, valled by response object
response.sendRedirect("page url");-------------

--address bar changes when there is change from one page to another,servlet res obj is needed to cal response
can only do forward
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
servlet life cycle
public void init(ServletConfig config)---invoked by web container only once,config for particular servlet
public void service(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse response)---invoked at each req by web container 
public void destroy()0--invoked only once and indicates that servlet is destroyed

================================================
servlet config
it is specific for each servlet. each holds configuration information for a particular servlet and it should be injected at time of initialization using
method:  init()

this initialization is taken care of servlet container manager

ServletConfig can access any paramater from web.xml

http container--each project--eg:pool
http session data(browser)--local maintanance eg:ppl in pool
servlet context---global maintaince,any changes should be affected to al servlet page,common to all ser page
getAttributr()
setAttribute()

servlet context is representing the servlet container where all servlets are running, It should be same and global for all kinds of servlet in the same project.
If v want to store some value in this context,it can be accessible by any servlet of the same project where value should be maintained by key-value pair.

To get servlectcontect reference dynamically, use the method getServletContext(). To set any value in context use method setAttribute(Attributename,attributevalue).
To reteive value from context use method getAttribute(Atrributename) which returns java.lang.obj, so downcasting is required.
