JSP used to create web application just like sevlet technology.

Advantage of JSP				Servlet
extension toservlet				business logic code here
easy to maintain
fast devleopment
presentation logic mainatined here

Life cyclce of JSP
JSP engine is part of web conatiner which compiles JSP page to servlet

1>transalation of JSP page
2>compiltaion of JSP page
3>class loading loaded by class loader
4>instantiation -obj of the generated servlet is created
5>initialization(jspInit() method is invoked by the container--possible to override)
6>request processing(_jspService() method is invoked by the container--cannot override coz its final method identified by method starting with '_')
7>destroy (jspDestroy() method is invoked by the container--possible to override)

NOTE:_jspService()--cannot override coz its final method identified by method starting with '_'

JSP API consists of 2 package
javax.servlet.jsp
javax.servlet.jsp.tagext

======================================================================
JSP Component
-----------------
JSP scriptlet tag
-----------------
<%
	java statement
%>
is used to execute java scource code in jsp

JSP expression
---------------
<%=name%>
code placed within JSP expression tag is written to the output stream of the response

JSP Declaration
---------------
used to declare fields and methods, is placed outside the service
<%!
	declare attribute and methods
%>


/*file name with extension*/--in action tag

inbuilt obj in java--in,out,err
inbuilt obj in jsp-request obj

no updation in web.xml in jsp file
view source in browser-only html code is seen not the java code

========================
JSP implicit object
out			JSPWrtiter
request			HttpServletRequest
response		HttpServletRequest
config			ServletConfig
application		ServletContext
session			Httpsession
pageContext		PageContext
page			object
exception		throwable

============
JSP directives --taken care by JSP translator-jsp-servlet
-----------
<%@
directive atrribute="value"%>
%>

page directive--used to set page attribute for current jsp page 
include directive-- used ti include the contents of any resource it may be jsp file,html or text file , at page translational time
taglib directive--many tags in jsp,used to perform some specific tasks,custom/external tag libraries can also be created or included

dont want default tag ,den use prefix to aceess from custom library

============================
JSP action tag--happens at processing tim
used to perform some specific tasks
used to control the flow between pages and to use java bean

<jsp.include>  includes another resource,to include dynamic content,action tag,processing,request tim it occurs	&&&& <%@include>to include static content,directive tag,translate tim

<jsp.forward>   forwards the request amd response to another resource

processing tim is action time

whatever written in jsp page, html java etc evrything becomes a service which is _jspService, evrything is sent to dis service method so cannot override this method

POJO-plain old java object

MVC
M
V-JSP
C-servlet
==============
JAVA BEAN
is a class that,to depict a real entity
shld have no arg contsructor
shld be serilizable
method to set and get value of properties,getter setter

------------
cookie
session-conversation state bw client and server
session.setMaxInactiveInterval(sec)
==============================================
JSTL(JSP standard tag library)
advanatge
fast development
code reusability
no need to use scriptlet tag
